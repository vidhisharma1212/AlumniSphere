Alumni who have taken both paths offer insights into the pros and cons. Graduate school can be beneficial for students who want to specialize further in their field or pursue a career in academia or research. However, for students eager to gain practical experience and start earning, entering the industry might be the better choice. Alumni emphasize that neither path is superior‚Äîit ultimately depends on individual career goals and industry requirements. They also suggest considering hybrid options, such as working in the industry for a few years before returning to graduate school.
